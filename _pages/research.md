I am Hiroaki Murayama, working on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. I am a medical student undergoing clinical rotations in [School of Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare](https://narita.iuhw.ac.jp/en/academics/medicine/) in Japan. 

I have regularly worked with [Asst. Prof. Akira Endo](https://akira-endo.github.io/) at [the National University of Singapore](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/faculty-directory/endo-akira/) on multiple studies related to infectious disease dynamics. Additionally, I work as a lab associate with [Asst. Prof. Robbie Parks](https://sparklabnyc.github.io/site/about_me.html) at [Columbia University](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/robbie-m-parks-phd), focusing on environmental epidemiology, particularly in relation to climate change and weather disasters such as tropical cyclones, developing spatio-temporal models within a Bayesian framework.

Previously, I served as a member of National COVID-19 Taskforce at Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, where I conducted ad-hoc COVID-19 analyses.
