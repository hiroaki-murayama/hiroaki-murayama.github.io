I am Hiroaki Murayama, working on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases. I am a medical student undergoing clinical rotations in [School of Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare](https://narita.iuhw.ac.jp/en/academics/medicine/) in Japan.

## Interests
### Infectious Disease Epidemiology
* Quantification of transmission dynamics and optimal control strategies
* Theoretical framework construction
* Network modelling
* Disentangling the heterogeneity  
* COVID-19, mpox, vector-borne diseases, STDs, etc.
* Interdisciplinary field between ID epidemiology and Environmental epidemiology
* Bayesian inference

My research work revolves around mathematical formulation of infectious disease dynamics drawing upon state-of-the-art mathematical/statistical/computational methodologies to comprehensively understand transmission dynamics across various scales, thereby contributing to adressing public health concerns and answering key questions.

In the case of directly transmitted diseases, each observed case is linked to its infector, creating the non-linear behaviour in the risk of infections. Consequently, there arises a necessity to reconstruct transmission dynamics through mathematical models that account for these non-i.i.d. settings.

My primary interest lies in quantifying natural history, transmission dynamics and control, disentangling such a unique non-i.i.d. situation. Additionally I aim to construct a robust theoretical framework, often using a Bayesian framework.  I am also interested in bridging the gap between infectious disease and environmental epidemiology.
