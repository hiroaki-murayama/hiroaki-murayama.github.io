- **16.Nov.2022.** A new paper (preprint) is out on medRxiv. I led this study as the first author: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.14.22282286" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-link zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> This is a follow-up study of our earlier work on monkeypox epidemiology (Endo et al. 2022. Science) that looks at why cases are now declining in many affected areas. In a nutshell, we suggested that the accumulation of infection-derived immunity in heavy-tailed sexual contact networks can explain the apparent slowdown in the growth of cases.
- **24.Sep.2022.** Listed as one of the contributors to the UKHSA-JUNIPER MPX Network Modelling Seminar, where my leading research and its findings were introduced: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-technical-briefings/investigation-into-monkeypox-outbreak-in-england-technical-briefing-8#sources-and-acknowledgments" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-link zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
- **22.Sep.2022.** A second-author paper is now out in Science as a first release: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.add4507" target="_blank"><i class="fas fa-fw fa-link zoom" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> We suggested that the rapid growth of the current monkeypox outbreak is likely driven by a small fraction of men who have sex with men and have many sexual partners.
